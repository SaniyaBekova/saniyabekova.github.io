        <h1>Who am I</h1>
        <p>I am <strong>Saniya Bekova</strong>, a <strong>Data Analytics and Computational Social Science</strong> student at the <strong>University of Massachusetts Amherst</strong>. I am a former software developer who is transitioning to Data Science.</p>
        <p>My journey into programming started in 2008 when I enrolled in the <strong>Information Systems</strong> program at <strong>Kazakh National Technical University named after K.I. Satbaev</strong> in Almaty.</p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>During my education, I worked part-time at the university in the Department of Information Technology, which was responsible for the university‚Äôs IT ecosystem.</p>
        <p>After graduation, I started working at <strong>Halyk Bank</strong> as a full-stack software developer in 2013. In my career as a software developer, I worked in the banking sector for 10 years, primarily using <strong>C#, .NET Core, and JavaScript</strong>.</p>
        <p>The main projects my team and I worked on were related to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual loans</li>
            <li>Mortgage programs</li>
            <li>Tender guarantees</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since 2020, I have been working as a backend software developer, using technologies like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camunda for BPMN schemas</li>
            <li>Kafka for messaging between systems</li>
            <li>Go for microservices</li>
            <li>JavaScript for logic in Camunda projects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In 2023, I won the <strong>Bolashak scholarship</strong> from my government, which covers my education at UMass Amherst, and I receive a monthly stipend for living expenses.</p>
        
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I love running and swimming. In 2019, I ran a full marathon, and in 2022, I swam 1.5 km in the <strong>Oceanman Almaty</strong> event. However, nowadays, I have no free time as I am occupied with my baby and university courses.</p>
        
        <h2>My Research Question</h2>
        <p>In the modern world, social media plays a crucial role in creating public opinion. Some people or organizations use bots to influence people‚Äôs opinions. Especially in my home country, people use <strong>Instagram and Facebook</strong> as political platforms for expressing their thoughts and views.</p>
        <p>For example, the trial of the former minister was held online thanks to activists on social media. However, there was a flood of fake news and comments, and the world needs tools to detect bots and fake news to uncover the truth.</p>
        <p><strong>My research question is:</strong> ‚ÄúHow can bots be identified in social media comments?‚Äù It seeks to find algorithms or methods to determine bot behavior.</p>
        
        <h2>Corpus</h2>
        <p>My corpus for this research will be comments from social media platforms such as <strong>Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (X)</strong>. These social media platforms are very popular in my country, and bot activity is growing every year.</p>
        <p>The selected corpus is particularly relevant for this research because social media comments represent spontaneous, unstructured discourse, making them an ideal medium for analyzing linguistic and behavioral patterns of bot-generated content.</p>
        <p>I haven‚Äôt had time to check whether there are APIs to get comments from these social media platforms. If I don‚Äôt find one, I‚Äôll most likely obtain the data through web scraping. I don‚Äôt yet have an idea of how to implement this and whether there is existing data for preliminary training of models.</p>
        <p>So, stay tuned‚Ä¶ üöÄ</p>
